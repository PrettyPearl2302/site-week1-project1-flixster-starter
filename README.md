### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

This project was my first experience with Javascript, so to be honest I felt unprepared to complete almost every feature. By the end of the lesson, I only understood how to pull an API/make an API request. With the help of my teachers, colleagues and ChatGPT, I was able to write complete javascript code. 

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have written a huge chunk of the code by myself. Right now half of it was with the help of friends and ChatGPT. I would have taken my time to learn how to write and execute functions in javascript. 

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I pulled th API correctly! I also figured how to create arrays in javascript so that my load more functtion was not overriding the display and search functions. Some of my peers were able to implement all the stretch featured, so I would like to do the same next time.
